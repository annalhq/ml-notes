## Basis

**Motivation:**
- First automation of repeated physical solutions: *Industrial revolution* 
- Second, automation of repeated mental solutions: *Digital revolution*
- Next step: allow machines to find solution themselves: We then only needs to specify a problem and/or goal

**Alan Turing's proposition:**
In his paper *Computing machinery and intelligence*, he proposed a question to *'Can machine think ?'*

**Highlight**: Three components of process to imitate an adult mind:
1. The initial state of the mind, say at birth
2. The education to which it has been subjected
3. Other experience, not to describe as education, to which it has been subjected
Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind, *why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child's*. If this were then subjected to an appropiate course of education one would obtain the adult brain.

> To be able to learn to make decisions to achieve goals

## What is reinforcement learning?
 
 - People and animals learn by **interacting with our environment**
- This differs from certain other types of learning
	- It is **active** rather than passive
	- Interactions are often sequential â€” future interactions can depend on earlier ones
- We are **goal-directed**
- We can learn **without examples** of optimal behaviour
- Instead, we optimise some **reward signal**
