- A reward $R_t$ is a scalar feedback signal
- Indicates how well agent is doing at step t - defines the goal
- The egent's job is to maximize cumulative reward
$$G_t = R_{t+1}+R_{t+2}+ \ ...$$
reinforcement learning is based on the **reward hypothesis.

> [!note] Reward Hypothesis
> Any goal can be formalized as the outcome of maximixing a cumulative reward

> [!info]
> We call the this cumulative reward as **return**
